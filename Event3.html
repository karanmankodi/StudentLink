<h3>Are Professors Avoiding the Public Square</h3>
        <img src="./Images/CurrentEvents/Event3.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" class="img-responsive" />
        <p>Thomas Whalen was happy to discuss whether professors like him don't talk to the public enough. He just needed a few minutes to tape an interview with New England Cable News.

He wishes more of his colleagues followed suit.

"I think they've kind of abdicated fromâ€¦the battlefield of ideas," says the College of General Studies associate professor of social sciences. Whalen's opinion echoes a recent argument by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof bemoaning the withdrawal from public discourse by academics. The vanished profs, Kristof said, prefer publishing their insights in arcane scholarly journals and books.
